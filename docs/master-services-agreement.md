# MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT

This Master Services Agreement ("Agreement") dated _________, 20__ is made between
Chris Zuber ("Developer"), a California-based developer and _________________ ("Client").

## RECITALS

WHEREAS, Developer is in the business of computer software consulting and
development services, hereinafter referred to as “Services”.

WHEREAS, Client desires to engage Developer to provide software consulting and
development services, and Developer agrees to perform such services, on the
terms and conditions set forth herein.

WHEREAS, Developer and Client agree that this Agreement shall apply to all
such future services.

THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and other
good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

## AGREEMENT

Developer agrees to perform services for Client as described in one or more
"Definition of Done" document; bug report, feature request, or milestone ticket
in project management software (“Statement of Work”). Should the need arise,
additional Statements of Work may be drafted and executed, and shall be considered
binding in reference to the specific project specified therein. Any conflict or
inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and any executed Statement
of Work shall be resolved by giving precedence to the executed Statement of Work
under which the Services are to be performed and then to this Agreement.

Where not contained within the individual Statements of Work, the methods of
service execution, forms and availability of communication, handling of payments,
conflict resolution, and all applicable terms shall be inherited from the
attached "Terms of Service" document.

### 1. Cooperation

Client shall assist Developer in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement and shall undertake the responsibilities specified in this Section 2
at its own expense. Client shall be reasonably available to Developer to make
binding decisions for Client regarding the obligations which are the subject of
this Agreement, and shall perform or have performed other duties and requirements
of Client as set forth in this Agreement or in an applicable Statement of Work.

#### 1.1 Official Communication

All official communications between the parties shall take place in a written
format for future reference. Examples of written communication may include, but
are not limited to, email, Slack messages, GitHub Issues and Milestones. The
parties agree that any verbal communication shall not be considered binding and
will not be relied upon to interpret or enforce the terms of this agreement.

#### 1.2 Definition of Done

The term "Definition of Done", for the purposes of this agreement, means a document
listing all required pages, functionality, and other expectations that define
when a project or feature should be considered complete. Any and all items that
are necessary predicates to those declared shall be considered included by
implication. No other requirements except those explicitly stated or necessary
for the fulfillment thereof shall be assumed to be included in this agreement.

This "Definition of Done" may be modified by Client via "Official Communication"
upon approval by Developer, with the possibility of a change in fees and/or rate
from Developer.

#### 1.3 Estimations, Timeline and Quotes

The parties acknowledge that the estimates provided in the Statement of Work are
based on information available to the Developer at the time of drafting and are
subject to change based on unforeseen circumstances or changes in Client requirements.
The Developer will use reasonable efforts to meet the estimated timelines, but
the parties agree that the estimates are not guarantees of completion dates.

The Client agrees to provide timely feedback and responses to the Developer's
requests for information or clarification. In the event that the Client fails
to respond to official communication in a timely manner, any estimated timelines
or deadlines shall be nullified until such time as the Client provides the
requested information or clarification.

For the purposes of this clause, "timely manner" shall mean within [number of days]
days of receipt of the Developer's request for information or clarification.
The parties acknowledge that delays in communication can impact the estimated
timeline and may result in additional costs or fees. The Client agrees to cooperate
with the Developer to minimize any such delays and to keep the Developer informed
of any factors that may impact the estimated timeline.

The parties acknowledge that changes to the scope of work or additional requirements
may impact the estimated timeline and may result in additional costs or fees. In
the event that the Client requests changes to the scope of work or additional
requirements, the Developer will provide an updated estimate for the additional
work, and the Client will have the opportunity to approve or reject the updated
estimate.

#### 1.4 Developer Transparency

Developer agrees, upon reasonable request of Client, to make the current
progress of the given project or feature readily known to Client to the best of
its ability. Fulfillment of this request is subject to the limitations of host,
etc.

### 2. Reliance

Client understands that Developer shall rely upon Section 2 herein and that
all official communications from Developer to Client shall be addressed to the
Client.

#### 2.1 Scope of Project or Feature

Scope shall be identified in "Statement of Work."

### 3. Work Provisions

#### 3.1 Independent Contractor

For all purposes hereof and in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, Developer is and shall remain an independent contractor and nothing
in this Agreement or in a Statement of Work shall be deemed or construed to
create an employer/employee, joint venture or partnership relationship between
Developer and Client. Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to create an
employment relationship between Client and Developer, or any employee, agent
or independent contractor of Developer. Neither party shall have any authority
to insure any obligations on behalf of the other party or to make any promise,
representation or contract of any nature on behalf of the other party.

#### 3.2 Developer’s Personnel

Developer will notify and receive authorization from Client before using
additional personnel to provide the Services. Unless otherwise stated in the
applicable Statement of Work, Developer shall have sole discretion over the
identity of personnel used to provide the Services, provided that Developer
shall ensure that the personnel are in all cases suitably qualified and experienced.

#### 3.3 Non-Exclusivity

Client recognizes that Developer’s personnel providing services to Client under
this Agreement may perform similar services from time to time for other persons,
and this Agreement shall not prevent Developer from using such personnel for
the performance of such similar services for such other persons. Developer
recognizes that Client may engage other consultants to perform similar services
from time to time, and this Agreement shall not prevent Client from using such
consultants.

### 4. Warranty of Authority; No Conflict

perform its obligations hereunder, and that its performance hereunder shall not
conflict with, limit or be contrary to any other agreement.

not to, directly or indirectly solicit or induce or attempt to persuade any
employee, independent contractor, vendor, supplier, outsourced third-party,
director or other participant of Client to terminate an employment, contractual
or other relationship with Client, or to enter into a relationship with Developer

had a relationship, or (c) seek to establish any rights, including but not limited
to intellectual property rights, anywhere in the world in conflict with Client’s
pre-existing, herein established, or hereafter established intellectual or other
property or proprietary rights.

### 7 Fees, Invoices, Payment

#### 7.1 Fees

Client shall pay Developer at the rate set forth on the applicable Statement
of Work. Additional work will be performed at the rate set forth on the Statement
of Work. Developer reserves the right to alter the billable rate on thirty (30)
days prior written notice to Client.

#### 7.2 Invoices

Developer shall invoice Client based on the timeline set forth in the applicable
Statement of Work. Any such invoice shall be payable by check fifteen (15) days
from the receipt thereof. Late payments shall accrue interest at a rate of the
lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate allowed
by law. In the event of any dispute with regard to a portion of an invoice, the
undisputed portion shall be paid as provided herein.

#### 7.3 Initial Payment/Deposit

Client agrees to pay Developer an agreed upon fraction of the total cost at the
start of development. This fraction of developer fees, determined by estimated
time of development, is non-refundable except in cases of negligence of Developer.
If Developer has made a best effort to satisfy the requirements of Client, this
fee is understood to be compensation for time spent at a reasonable hourly rate.

The final invoice from Developer to Client may include all pending fees for any
additional charges incurred during the final segment of development as demanded
by costs taken on by Developer during that segment. 

#### 7.4 Resolving Disputes of Payment

The parties agree that the Definition of Done, as defined in Section 1.2 of the
Statement of Work (SOW), shall be used to determine if Developer has completed
the Work. Developer shall complete the Work in accordance with the Definition of
Done, and Client shall be responsible for approving the completed Work or
providing feedback to Developer.

In the event of any dispute arising out of or related to this agreement, including
but not limited to the satisfaction of the "Definition of Done," the parties agree
to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted
by a mutually agreed-upon third-party arbitrator, and the decision of the arbitrator
shall be final and binding on both parties. The arbitration proceedings shall be
conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA)
then in effect. The arbitration shall take place in the County of Kern in the
State of California unless the parties mutually agree to a different location.
The parties agree to bear their own costs and expenses incurred in the arbitration,
including any travel, lodging, or other expenses.

Notwithstanding the above, if the arbitrator determines that a party has acted
in bad faith or frivolously in the course of the arbitration, the arbitrator may
award reasonable attorney's fees and costs to the other party. The parties acknowledge
that the cost of the job makes paying any attorney fees impractical, and agree
that they will not seek or recover any such fees or costs from the other party,
except as provided in this paragraph.

The arbitrator shall have the authority to award any relief that would be available
in a court of law or equity, including but not limited to monetary damages and
injunctive relief. The arbitrator shall have no authority to modify or change any
term or provision of this agreement. The parties acknowledge and agree that the
decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on both parties and that
the parties waive any right to appeal or challenge the decision of the arbitrator.

The parties agree to cooperate fully with the arbitrator in the conduct of the
arbitration proceedings and to provide any information or documentation reasonably
requested by the arbitrator. The parties agree to keep the proceedings confidential
and not to disclose any information regarding the proceedings or the award, except
as necessary to enforce the award or as otherwise required by law.

This arbitration clause shall survive the termination or expiration of this
agreement and shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. By
signing below, the parties acknowledge that they have read and understand this
arbitration clause and agree to be bound by its terms.

#### 7.6 Intermediate Payments

At minimal, Client is entitled to review progress at intervals of when invoicing
is given to Client. During said review, upon approval of progress and trajectory,
Client is obligated to compensate Developer for all pending costs thus-far. In
example, should payment be distributed into 3 fractional payments where Client
is making the second of three payments to Developer, payment of the second
installment makes the first installment non-refundable, and makes the second
subject to an assessment of completion relative to the overall estimation of the
project.

#### 7.6 Expenses

Client shall reimburse Developer for all materials and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under
this Agreement (“Expenses”). Examples would include, but not be limited to,
travel expenses, project hosting, and server or technology costs beyond those
required for code development. Specific costs may include, but may not be limited
to, any examples listed in the applicable Statement of Work.

### 8 Intellectual Property

including, but not limited to source code and documentation associated therewith.
Examples of Type A Deliverables include the specification and implementation of
Ruby on Rails model and controller classes, used by the developers and analysts
to build applications.

##### 8.1.3 "Type B Deliverables"

"Type B Deliverables" shall mean Deliverables that are not specific to Client's

source code, and all modifications to the foregoing, and all portions thereof,
together with all proprietary rights relating thereto, including, without
limitation, all copyrights, patent and trade secret rights, are owned exclusively
by Client.

#### 8.3 Works-for-hire

Type A Deliverables shall be deemed works-for-hire and shall be the exclusive
property of Client. Developer expressly agrees to assign to Client the copyright
in any Type A Deliverables that do not meet the requirements of a work-for-hire
under the U.S. Copyright Act, as soon as such work is fixed in a tangible form
or medium. Except as otherwise set forth herein, the entire right, title and
interest in and to Type B Deliverables, including, without limitation, the

considered theft of Intellectual Property by Client and subject to any and all
actions of legal recourse by Developer, including application of proprietary
methods or data owned by Client. Developer makes no claim of ownership over any
Proprietary information from client, only implementation of methods to utilize
Proprietary information, pending payment from Client.

Under no circumstances whatsoever shall Developer come into possession of
any proprietary information, trade secrets, patents, or any other forms of 
intellectual property owned by Client in the course of the development of this
project. It is hereby emphasized that any document or communication stating
otherwise shall be deemed null and void. Even if Client were to grant Developer
ownership of user data obtained through the project or collected previously,
Developer is strictly prohibited from ever acquiring such data. The sole exception 
of this clause is a bill of sale from Client to Developer.

### 9 Publicity

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, Developer shall be
permitted to disclose in summary form the nature of the work performed for Client
under applicable Statement of Work. Such disclosure includes a description of
the technology utilized by Developer, but Developer shall not disclose the
proprietary business processes of Client.
