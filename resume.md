## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- Use [structured data](https://schema.org) to follow guidelines designed by a committee of search engines to instruct search engines how to understand content - "This is an article written by this author in this genre"
- Follow Google's advice - "Create great content and a great experience for your users"
- Where applicable, markup meets the requirements for Google's "Rich Results" cards
- Understand how performance, responsiveness, accessibility, etc. affects search engine ranking of pages

## Compatibility
- Built and maintain a whole library that makes all modern browsers have all necessary functionality even if they do not natively provide it
- Use "Progressive Enhancement"  and feature detection to provide an improved experience to better browsers without breaking the site/app for other users
- Even in cases where a browser fails to load/an error does occur, the content of the site is still available
- Extensive knowledge of which of the many browsers with different versions on different Operating Systems support a give set of features, plus checking for browser support when needed

## Performance
- The less work a browser has to do to load a page and the less it has to fetch, the faster it'll be
- By default, static site generators are used, so there is zero time spent in a server creating a page on each request - the page is created ahead of time, cached, and reused until changed
- Where live data is needed, it isn't fetched until needed, so images and components do not have to all load once the user visists a page
- In-depth knowledge of how browsers work and what a page needs allows for things like pre-fetching data ahead of time, responsive images, lazy loading, non-blocking scripting, hardware accelerated animations, etc.

## Security

**Mozilla Observatory Results**

![Observatory Results](https://i.imgur.com/bmm22CR.png)

- Unauthorized scripts and assets cannot be loaded - Content-Security-Policy
- Scripts are limited in what they can do without an allowed Trusted Type Policy
- No back-end or database to attack - complete immunity to many common attacks
- Runs through GitHub - all code must be cryptographically signed and users must have 2FA, and only authorized users can make any changes
- Code must pass manual and automated security audits/reviews in order to make it into the production site
- Automated updates (has to pass tests and requires approval of changes)
- Code is written on a laptop with full-disk encryption and a very strong password, and all changes are cryptographically signed

## Accessibility
- Follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- Implement & use Accessibility Object Model (AOM) as needed
- Sites actually tested with a screen reader, not just synthetic tests
- Through use of a screen reader, pain points are discovered and dealt with (e.g. adding a hidden "skip to content" link available through screen readers & keyboard navigation)

## Web Apps
- Where beneficial and wanted, these sites may be upgraded to a "Progressive Web App" (PWA), a cross-platform and web based type of app that can integrate with the Operating System like a native app does
- Native apps - PWAs may be packaged as native apps for Android, Windows, & iOS without having a separate codebase to write and maintain
- Even without installing, sites may use app-like features such as using native share dialogs, theming including scrollbars and the status bar, requesting location, etc
- Dark/light themes supported based on user preference
